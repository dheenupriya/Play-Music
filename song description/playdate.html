            <p>
                You call me on the telephone, you feel so far away<br>
                You tell me to come over, there's some games you want to play<br>
                I'm walking to your house, nobody's home<br>
                Just me and you and you and me alone<br>
                We're just playing hide and seek<br>
                It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you<br>
                I don't want to play no games<br>
                I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you<br>
                I don't give a fuck about you anyways<br>
                Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?<br>
                You never share your toys or communicate<br>
                I guess I'm just a play date to you<br>
                Wake up in your bedroom and there's nothing left to say<br>
                When I try to talk you're always playing board games<br>
                I wish I had monopoly over your mind<br>
                I wish I didn't care all the time<br>
                We're just playing hide and seek<br>
                It's getting hard to breathe under the sheets with you<br>
                I don't want to play no games<br>
                I'm tired of always chasing, chasing after you<br>
                I don't give a fuck about you anyways<br>
                Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?<br>
                You never share your toys or communicate<br>
                I guess I'm just a play date to you<br>
                Ring around the rosy<br>
                I never know, I never know what you need<br>
                Ring around the rosy, I want to give you, want to give you<br>
                What you need<br>
                I don't give a fuck about you anyways<br>
                Whoever said I gave a shit 'bout you?<br>
                You never share your toys or communicate<br>
                I guess I'm just a play date to you<br>
                You know I give a fuck about you everyday<br>
                Guess it's time that I tell you the truth<br>
                If I share my toys, will you let me stay?<br>
                Don't want to leave this play date with you<br>
