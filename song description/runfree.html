            <p>
                I still remember<br>
                Loving the danger<br>
                You set me on fire<br>
                When I'm by your side (by your side)<br>
                You taking me higher<br>
                I follow you down, if we go down<br>
                Now you say you wanna get away<br>
                You wanna take me all the way<br>
                Might get burned, if you get too closer<br>
                To the sun, I want yah<br>
                We can burn together, fading into one another<br>
                Ooooh<br>
                <br>
                Well don't you know<br>
                You're still heaven to me<br>
                Baby we could run free<br>
                If you do it just the way I like<br>
                Maybe I could waste my time on you<br>
                Never mind all our worries<br>
                If you do it just the way I like<br>
                Maybe I could waste my time on you<br>
                My deepest of secrets<br>
                Trust you to keep 'em<br>
                Hiding the worlds<br>
                You cannot say<br>
                <br>
                I got what you wanted<br>
                I got what you needed<br>
                It's all in the way<br>
                That you say my name<br>
                Might get burned, if you get too closer<br>
                To the sun, I want yah<br>
                We can burn together, fading into one another<br>
                Ooooh<br>
                <br>

          <p>Deep Chills is the fifth studio album from Belgian electro-industrial band Lords of Acid.
              It was released on 10 April 2012 on Metropolis Records and marks the band's first studio
               album in 12 years. It is also their first studio album to be released on Metropolis. 
               With the exception of Praga Khan, who founded the band, Deep Chills features an entirely
                new lineup from previous releases and marks the first time an American vocalist to take
             on vocal duties for an album.The album features guest vocals from porn star Alana Evans on
              "Pop That Tooshie", as well as vocals from Zak Bagans, star of Ghost Adventures 
              and host of Paranormal Challenge, on the track "Paranormal Energy". The collaboration
              with Zak Bagans has spawned a collaborative side project between Bagans and Khan titled
               Necrofusion. In addition, there is also a song dedicated to the official Lords of Acid 
               fan club and online community, Children of Acid. The album's cover art was designed by 
               Karl Kotas and is a spoof of Cheap Thrills by Big Brother and the Holding Company</p>
