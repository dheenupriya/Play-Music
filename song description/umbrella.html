            <p>
                You have my heart<br>
                We'll never be worlds apart<br>
                May be in magazines<br>
                But you'll still be my star<br>
                Baby, 'cause in the dark<br>
                You can't see shiny cars<br>
                And that's when you need me there<br>
                With you I'll always share<br>
                Because<br>
                
                When the sun shine, we shine together<br>
                Told you I'll be here forever<br>
                Said I'll always be your friend<br>
                Took an oath and I'm stick it out till the end<br>
                Now that it's raining more than ever<br>
                Know that we still have each other<br>
                You can stand under my umbrella<br>
                You can stand under my umbrella<br>
                
                (Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)<br>
                Under my umbrella<br>
                (Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)<br>
                Under my umbrella<br>
                (Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)<br>
                Under my umbrella<br>
                (Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)<br>
                
                These fancy things<br>
                Will never come in between<br>
                You're part of my entity<br>
                Here for infinity<br>
                When the war has took its part<br>
                When the world has dealt its cards<br>
                If the hand is hard<br>
                Together we'll mend your heart<br>
                Because<br>
                
                When the sun shine, we shine together<br>
                Told you I'll be here forever<br>
                Said I'll always be your friend<br>
                Took an oath and I'm stick it out till the end<br>
